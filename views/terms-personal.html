          11.0 Refund and Chargeback
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>11.1 If you want to claim a chargeback, you have to raise a ticket through the application mentioning the
            reason. These reasons offer an explanation as to why you are disputing the transaction. Each reason
            has its own set of rules (filing time limits, necessary documentation, etc.). CashBaba will check the
            customer’s chargeback claim, making sure all the regulations have been addressed.
            If you have a valid claim, the funds will be removed from the merchant’s wallet account and credited
            to yours. If it is not a valid claim, the chargeback will be voided.
            If the chargeback is justified, the merchant may be forced to accept the losses. However, if the
            business has sufficient compelling evidence (documentation to prove the chargeback is invalid), the
            merchant can re-present the chargeback for review. If a chargeback process is successful it will auto
            reconcile your account, CashBaba and Merchant. Merchant will be liable to pay the fees associated
            with disputed transaction.</li>
          <li>11.2. If you want to return a purchase or want to refund for non-delivery items it will be followed by the
            merchant’s prescribed terms and conditions. If the merchant finds the request valid as per his/her
            business policy, he will initiate the refund through the application. Merchant will be liable to pay
            the fees associated with transaction amount.</li>
          <li>11.3 In case of Refund/Chargeback, the money will be refunded to the original payment method you
