          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>12.1 Chargeback will be claimed by wallet account holder through raising a ticket from app or web portal. Each chargeback is accompanied by a reason. These reasons offer an explanation as to why the consumer is disputing the transaction. Each reason has its own set of rules (filing time limits, necessary documentation, etc.). CashBaba will check the customer’s chargeback claim, making sure all the regulations have been addressed.</li>
            <li>If the customer has a valid claim, the funds will be removed from your wallet account and credited to the customer’s account. If the account holder doesn’t have a valid claim, the chargeback will be voided. </li>
            <li>If the chargeback is justified, you should accept the losses. However, if the business has sufficient compelling evidence (documentation to prove the chargeback is invalid), the merchant can re-present the chargeback for review. If a chargeback process is successful it will auto reconcile customer, CashBaba and Merchant. Merchant will be liable to pay the fees associated with disputed transaction. </li>
            <li>12.2 If a customer wants to return a purchase or want to refund for non-delivery items it will be followed by the merchant’s prescribed terms and conditions. If you find the request valid as per your business policy, you can initiate the refund through the application. Merchant will be liable to pay the fees associated with transaction amount. </li>
            <li>12.3 The official website of CashBaba (www.cashbaba.com.bd) and the merchant application (Android/ iOS) will provide you the access to initiate a Refund or a VOID transaction. </li>
            <li>12.4 Through the CashBaba 'settlement' feature, you will be able to VOID or cancel any transaction done by mistakenly after it has been authorized but before it has been settled. </li>
            <li>12.5 In case of Refund/Chargeback, the money will be refunded to the original payment method buyer used for the transaction such as- a debit card, credit card, or CashBaba account. </li>
            <li>12.6 If we receive a request for Refund/chargeback of payment, the dispute resolution process will be followed and it will vary case to case. </li>
