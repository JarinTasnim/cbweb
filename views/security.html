        <p>
          We use encryption and tokenization technology to protect all sensitive
          data of the user. This technique allows only valid and authorized
          request to access the data which ensures that even if it is in wrong
          hand it can't be accessed since it is not in a readable format. Only
          system itself can access the data and no one has access to it.

        <h3>Two-Factor Authentication</h3>
        <p>
          To keep your transaction safe and secure as an additional layer of
          security, we have used two-factor authentication- User Name & Password
          and OTP. With this additional level of security, user's transactions
          become much safer. It safeguards sensitive information from any
          malpractices.
